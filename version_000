''' 

version (v000). testing waters. this will either be modified or changed completely. 

but hey, why not share it? won't kill me. plus, whoever wants to hop on the 'trust restoration' train with me, 'ess go.

and whoever wants to copycat? coolio. the vision will be carried. as long as transparency wins, i'm coolio with it.

idgaf who gets the credit. if we lose trust, we lose society.the last thing to worry about is the credit.

ok, enough speech. let's get shit done.
