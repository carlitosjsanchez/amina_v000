# amina_v000
amina v000 of a chatbot to communicate with the public sector.

this is the birth of a potential final attempt to grasp our hands to establish trust between our community, and ourselves.

this project stems from a water filter i built for heavy metal ion removal for my local municipality in southern Mexico.

long story short, we did it... but we solved the outcome. not the problem.

the real problem was no transparency between the citizens and the public sector.

the mayor and his sons...killed.

1/2 the village no longer has potable water.

invasive mining got the better of them.

and so did trust.

so this project is the continuation of a year-long trek to solve a human problem: transparency, government, trust.

the ethereal dream is that something regulates government.

the constitution (of any country) was meant for that... to control the government... not it's citizens.

laws (at the local & state level) are for citizens, tbh. some apply to the government, but not all.

but now, we're losing that ideology.

so we must adapt to the modern circumstances. and use what we got.

and if the public sector does not want to be held accountable, then it will go down by force.

it is amina's mission: to protect those who cannot protect themselves.

and if we perish in the attempt to restore trust (aka the world's most powerful currency):

so be it.

climb the mountain with me or perish into the arms of chaos.
